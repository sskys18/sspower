# Writing Plans

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context and questionable taste. Document everything: which files to touch, code, testing, docs, how to verify. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md` (user preferences override)

## Pre-flight: read project wiki

Before drafting the plan, read these if they exist:

- `<cwd>/.claude/wiki/decisions.md` — prior architectural calls; align plan with them or flag conflicts
- `<cwd>/.claude/wiki/sessions/` — last 3 session `.md` files for recent project state

Skip silently if the directory doesn't exist.

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, suggest breaking into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified. Design units with clear boundaries and one clear responsibility per file. Prefer smaller, focused files. Files that change together should live together — split by responsibility, not technical layer. In existing codebases, follow established patterns.

## Task Format

See `references/plan-template.md` for the full plan header and task template with code examples.

Each step is one action (2-5 minutes). Every step must contain actual content — exact file paths, complete code, exact commands with expected output.

## No Placeholders — These Are Plan Failures

Never write:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how
- References to types/functions not defined in any task

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, check:
1. **Spec coverage:** Every spec section maps to a task?
2. **Placeholder scan:** Any banned patterns from above?
3. **Type consistency:** Names match across tasks?

Fix issues inline. If spec requirement has no task, add the task.

## Codex Spec Review (MANDATORY)

<HARD-GATE>
After self-review, run an independent Codex spec-review. Skipping this step is a plan failure.

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-bridge.mjs" spec-review \
  --prompt @docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md
```

Block on the structured `verdict`:
- `approve` → proceed to Execution Handoff.
- `needs-attention` → fix every issue from the `issues[]` array inline in the plan, then re-run spec-review until `approve`. Do NOT proceed to execution with unresolved findings.
- `reject` → discard the plan, return to brainstorming.

Save the review structured output under `docs/reviews/<plan-name>-spec-review.json` if the user requests an audit trail.
</HARD-GATE>

## Execution Handoff

**"Plan complete. Three execution options:**
1. **Subagent-Driven (recommended)** → sspower:subagent-driven-development
2. **Inline Execution** → sspower:executing-plans
3. **Codex execute** → delegate via `codex-bridge.mjs implement --write` or `codex-bridge.mjs rescue --write`

**Which approach?"**
